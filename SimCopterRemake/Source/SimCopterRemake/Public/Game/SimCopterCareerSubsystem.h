// The half of the original's career record the hangar shell reads and writes, plus the mission
// log it prints.
//
// Decoded from SimCopter.exe (Docs/scratchpad/ghidra/heli_tools_models_decode_20260724.md):
//
//   career + 0x40  money        FUN_00407a70 read / FUN_00407a90 add (clamped at 0)
//   career + 0x44  helicopter ownership bitmask, bit = runtime type index
//   career + 0x48  equipment ownership bitmask
//   career + 0x50  score
//   career + 0x54  tear gas rounds
//
//   FUN_0042d840   the shop's purchase path: catalog row -> index permutation, then set the bit
//   FUN_0048b050   helicopter price = *(int*)(&DAT_00504128 + type * 0x5c), i.e. the per-type
//                  block's "+0x44 New Cost", which heli.twk overwrites (FUN_00489e20)
//   FUN_0048b070   trade-in value = price - depreciation, floored at price / 2
//   FUN_0048b1a0   "take delivery": sets the ownership bit and parks the new aircraft on a pad
//
// Money and score already live on the mission system (its session record is the same career
// block), so they are deliberately not duplicated here; this subsystem owns what nothing else
// did - which helicopters are on the books, what they cost, and the log.
//
// It hangs off the game instance rather than an actor so a career survives the travel between
// the front end and the city level, exactly as USimCopterSessionSubsystem does.

// Which original log line an entry was printed from. The values are the resource string ids the
// original formats with (SimCopter.exe STRINGTABLE, English block).
