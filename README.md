# SimCopter Remake — Timmyty gameplay fork

This customized version builds on [JamesIV4's original remake](https://github.com/JamesIV4/sim-copter-remake)
and [wyozi's fork](https://github.com/wyozi/sim-copter-remake). Their commit history and authorship are retained.

**This fork intentionally changes original gameplay.** It adds nonlethal police tasers on foot
and from a helicopter passenger seat, an AI helper pilot, towing/capture equipment, expanded
medical care, parachuting, revised visuals and controls, and the 21-track KINV station.
Airborne police tasers are a fictional addition, not authentic 1996 SimCopter behavior.
Taser hits immobilize living criminals for handcuffing and police delivery; they do not fire
bullets or kill the target. Separate Apache weapons and other game hazards still exist.

Use Git LFS when cloning: custom music, textures, Unreal assets and the Windows icon are
included through LFS. Supply your original game data and the required Unreal/NVIDIA build
dependencies locally. This source publication is not a new prebuilt Windows release.

## Original upstream project overview

The following describes the upstream remake's foundation. Its fidelity goals describe
the original project; the deliberate changes in this fork are listed above.

**SimCopter Remake** is a ground-up reimplementation of Maxis's 1996 PC game _SimCopter_, built in Unreal Engine 5.

The goal is to recreate the original game as faithfully as possible while making it run properly on modern PCs. It retains the original missions, helicopters, flight behavior, city importing, radio stations, and assorted Sim weirdness, but adds modern rendering, widescreen support, longer view distances, improved controls, and native support for current versions of Windows.

Several _SimCity 2000_ cities, including Cape Wells, Tokyo, and Rio, are included so you can start flying right away. You can also import your own `.sc2` cities and fly around them just as you could in the original game.

## Recreating the Original Game

A lot of the work on SimCopter Remake has gone into reproducing how the original game actually behaved rather than simply making a new helicopter game that looks similar.

- **SimCity 2000 cities:** Play the original 30 career cities, load included sandbox cities such as Cape Wells, Egypt Falls, Tokyo, and Rio, or import your own `.sc2` files from _SimCity 2000_. Terrain, water, roads, bridges, and buildings are converted into a flyable 3D city.

- **Original helicopter fleet:** The full helicopter progression returns, starting with the Schweizer 300 and continuing through the Bell 206 JetRanger, MD 500, MBB Bo 105, Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin, and Boeing CH-47 Chinook. Flight and landing behavior are based on the parameters and rules used by the original game.

- **Missions and career progression:** Emergency calls appear throughout the city and completing them earns money and points. Missions include transporting passengers, evacuating medical patients, fighting fires, rescuing people from rooftops and the water, clearing traffic jams, breaking up riots, and helping police apprehend criminals.

- **SimCopter's strange little world:** The remake also keeps the less serious parts of the game: blocky Sims waving frantically from rooftops, pedestrians ending up where they probably shouldn't, and the occasionally questionable logic of 1990s Sim AI.

- **Cockpit equipment:** The searchlight, megaphone, water bucket, rescue harness, water cannon, and tear gas all return, along with the familiar radar, fuel gauge, altimeter, speedometer, and passenger display.

- **Radio stations:** The original Rock, Classical, Jazz, Techno, and Mix stations are supported, including the music, DJs, and wonderfully odd commercials that played while you flew around the city.

## Modern Improvements

The underlying game is intentionally kept close to the original, but a number of things have been updated where the limitations of a 1996 PC game don't need to be preserved.

- **Modern rendering:** Cities now have a dynamic day/night cycle, nighttime lighting, shadows, reflections, and modern indirect lighting through Unreal Engine 5.8.

- **Higher resolutions and frame rates:** The game supports modern resolutions including 1080p, 1440p, 4K, and ultrawide displays, with frame rates no longer tied to the limitations of the original game.

- **Keyboard, mouse, and controller support:** Controls have been adapted for modern keyboard/mouse setups as well as Xbox, PlayStation, and other dual-stick controllers, with configurable flight inputs.

- **Native modern Windows support:** The remake is a 64-bit application designed to run directly on current Windows systems rather than relying on compatibility modes, wrappers, or emulation.

- **Longer view distance:** The extremely aggressive distance fog of the original game is no longer necessary. You can climb above the city and actually see much more of it beneath you.

## How It Was Made

SimCopter Remake was built through a combination of **decompilation, analysis, and reimplementation of the original game**.

Instead of trying to recreate SimCopter's behavior by eye, I analyzed the original executable and game data to understand how its systems worked. That includes things such as helicopter parameters, flight calculations, building generation, mission logic, controls, and the formats used by the game's assets and city data.

Those systems have then been reimplemented in Unreal Engine rather than simply wrapping or modifying the original executable.

That approach matters because SimCopter has a very particular feel. Some of it is intentional, some of it is probably the result of how a PC game was written in 1996, and some of it is just strange. I wanted to preserve that rather than "fixing" the game until it no longer felt like SimCopter.

The result is intended to behave like the game I remember playing in 1996, just without needing a 1996 computer to enjoy it.
