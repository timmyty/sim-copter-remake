# --- per-family surface shading -----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The three shared numbers above are a reasonable average for buildings and roads, and they are
# WRONG for the three surfaces that read as material rather than as architecture:
#
#   * Trees blew out to white in bright sun. Two causes stack. The palette texel can be near 1.0
#     albedo, which under a physically scaled 120,000-lux sun tonemaps to white all by itself; and
#     the sprite card's normal is biased to world up (CardNormalUpBias), so at noon EVERY card in
#     the city faces the sun at once and the 0.3 specular puts one broad highlight across the whole
#     canopy. Real foliage is dark and almost non-specular and never does either.
#   * The ground was too bright and too shiny for the same albedo reason plus the same 0.3.
#   * Water was not shiny ENOUGH, because it was sharing the dirt's matte numbers.
#
# So those three take their roughness, specular and an ALBEDO CEILING from the day/night collection
# instead of the shared constants, published live by USimCopterDayNightSubsystem::PublishSurfaceShading
# off the SimCopter.Shading.* console variables. Live because these are look knobs: they want to be
# turned while looking at the city at noon, not edited here and re-baked.
#
# The ceiling is on ALBEDO because a material cannot see its own lit result - there is nothing to
# clamp after the lighting. Bounding albedo bounds the diffuse, which is what "too bright" is.
#
# **These names must match SurfaceShadingParameterNames in SimCopterDayNight.cpp.** A collection
# parameter whose name does not resolve compiles to a constant zero, and a zero albedo ceiling is a
# black surface, not an obviously-broken one.

# into the frame buffer and there was no lighting model to consult. Emissive is a number of nits,
# though, and a fixed number of nits is only a fixed *brightness* while the exposure holds still.
#
# It stopped holding still. The level's CelestialVaultDaySequenceActor runs a physically scaled sun
# at 120,000 lux; the day/night actor it replaced ("New TOD system", 2026-08-03) ran it at 4 lux
# (SimCopterDayNightCycleActor::SunIntensityDay). Auto exposure follows the sun, so the exposure now
# sits ~30,000x higher than everything here was tuned against, and an emissive of 1.4 tonemaps to
# BLACK next to a road at ~23,000 nits. That is what turned the fire, the water spray, the dust, the
# tear gas and the blinking marker cards into black quads.
#
# So the emissive has to be a real number of nits, on the same scale as the sun lighting the city.
# `EmissiveNits` is that number, and `USimCopterEffectExposureSubsystem` writes it every frame from
# the level's actual key light: a card sits EffectBrightness times as bright as white ground under
# the same sun, which holds at noon, at dusk and at midnight without anything being retuned.
#
# **The obvious fix does not work here.** A `MaterialExpressionEyeAdaptationInverse` divides out the
# exposure in the shader and would need no C++ at all - it is what this was written with first. It
# had no effect whatsoever in game (verified: the rebuilt material was live, the material compiled
# clean, the cards stayed black), and the node is documented as experimental access to the eye
# adaptation RT for post process materials. Do not "simplify" back to it without testing on screen.
#
# The lights are the same problem with a different fix: `ULocalLightComponent::InverseExposureBlend`
# reads the exposure on the RENDERER side, not out of a shader buffer, and that one does work.

# at the default 1.0 the card shades exactly like the flat ground it stands on, which is the whole

# normal back in (the face-type-13 polygons are the only geometry here with meaningful normals).

# Ground detail material: same TILED1 texturing + lit shading as MI_TerrainLow/High, but it perturbs
# the surface normal with four octaves of procedural value noise (fine / medium / large / extra large),
# each with its own amplitude and scale, so the otherwise smooth terrain lighting gets organic relief.
# The perturbation is added on top of the mesh's smoothed rest normal (BaseNormal = VertexNormalWS)
# and scaled by a per-vertex weight (vertex-color R) the renderer bakes: 0 near the land/water
# shoreline (and ramping in away from flat building/road pads) so it never disturbs the water weld or
# the crisp pads, ramping to 1 over open ground. Value noise gives an analytic gradient (one 4-corner
# hash per octave, no finite differences); cell coords are wrapped to keep the sin-hash stable far
# from the origin.
#
# Two exits before any of that runs, and both give exactly `normalize(BaseNormal)` - which is what
# the last line returns when the gradient is zero:
#
#   * Weight 0 is the shoreline and the flat building/road pads, where the whole point is that the
#     noise contributes nothing. Free in both graphics modes.
#   * Low Power skips it everywhere. Four octaves is four hashed 4-corner lookups per pixel across
#     the entire ground plane, which is the most expensive material in the city by area, and what it
#     buys is relief the original's flat-shaded terrain never had.
